# Conquering Responsive Layouts

This repository contains notes and solutions of going through the Conquering Responsive Layouts free course from Kevin Powell. This was a daily drip course, meaning that content for the the course was put out daily instead of all at once. The goal of this repo  is to do something similar and put each day in their own directory.
