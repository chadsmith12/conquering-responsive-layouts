# Day 4 Challenge

Day 4 is the toughest day yet when new to CSS as it challenges you to start from scratch and create your own markup and styles based on a mockup. While the mockup is simple it challenges you to use everything we have learned in the previous days so far, plus more if youd don't already know a lot of CSS.

The mockup that is attempting to be replicated is located at this Figma: [Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/dGPcL6Ym2avOt4736aHb2B/conquer-responsive-layout-week-1-final-challenge?node-id=0%3A1)
